Tutorial-1.7.2
==============

Demo of various topics covered in my forge tutorials, namely IExtendedEntityProperties and custom inventories,
with updated network code, a working mana bar, an item that uses mana, and a custom player inventory that can
only hold the mana item. I may add more later.

Please note that the Wizard Armor still does not render a colored overlay, despite being dyable.
